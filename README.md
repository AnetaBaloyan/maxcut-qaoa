# QAOA for solving Maximum Cut problem.

In this repository, I am experimenting with Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) by using it 
for solving the Maximum Cut problem. 

Please see the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AnetaBaloyan/maxcut-qaoa/blob/master/maxcut.ipynb)
for the problem statement and the solution.
